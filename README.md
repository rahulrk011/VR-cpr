# VR CPR Simulation in Unity using Google Cardboard

# VR CPR Simulation

The increasing need to learn and simulate Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has only increased rapidly, after covid-19 pandemic, and continues to rise drastically. Since most things in life during the pandemic have become virtual, we decided to use Virtual reality to simulate how a person can conduct CPR correctly. We wanted to create this project in a way that can be played repeatedly, which can allow the user to perform the CPR as many times as they would like to learn it properly. We provide information on how the CPR should be done, simulate a possible scenario where a possible CPR is needed, and show proper movements, and actions required to perform CPR on a person. Lastly, we implement a quiz for the user to test their knowledge on how much they have learnt about CPR through this virtual CPR simulation. We used Google Cardboard as our virtual device since it is the most affordable, and convenient for most people. We also worked on the project using Unity 3D development software, and C# programming language. 

# Pre-CPR procedures (the user is the person conducting the CPR in the simulation): 
-The user looks around and checks to see if there is a person in need of CPR ( in a life threatening situation).
-After identifying the patient, the user checks to see if the patient is breathing. 
   	 -The user then should tap and check if patient responds (moves/talks)
   	 -The user should then check if the patient is breathing properly.
-Even before conducting the CPR, the first thing the user should do is to acquire a phone and call 911 for immediate emergency care as soon as possible.
-After that, the user should check patient's pulse ( for max 10 seconds )
    	 -If the user is unsure about the pulse, or cannot locate the pulse, the user should immediately start the CPR.

# CPR procedures:
-The user should be beside the patient. (the patient should lay horizontally in front of the user).
-The patient should be laid on a flat surface (floor, bed, etc)
-The user should remove clothes from the patientâ€™s chest area to conduct the CPR effectively without obstructions.
-The user should have the correct hand position and posture for the chest compressions.
      		1. Heel of 1 hand should be on the breastbone (between the nipples)
    	 	 2. The other hand should be on top of the first hand, fingers should be interlaced.
      		3. Make sure that the pressure applied is from the heels of the hand (not the fingers)
